I wish I were an interesting person. Why am I so petrified of actually doing something? I put all this effort into trying to create _something_, a place to write without any expectation that anyone will actually read anything. I guess the idea itself is if I actually put effort into creating the thing it exists on then I'll be more prone to use it. And as we all know that doesn't work. It never does. I get burnt out on the idea of it very quickly, especially after I spend the inordinant amount of time on the configuration step. And then I give up and move on to the next thing I will inevitably give up not long after starting. 

I need a hobby. A creative outlet. One far removed from technology. 

But for real, why am I like this? Why can't I just sit down and paint? What is my blocker? Why does it take SO much effort to actually do anything creatively? Almost like a physical wall prevents me from actually doing anything. Why can't I be normal? I have a ton of random bullshit in my head I just wish I could suction out and into something worthwhile. Something instead of driving me up the wall about my inability to do this....
