description: Hi, hello, is this thing on? This is mainly something to get populate the site with more junk.
Summary: If it snows, but there's a pandemic and people are working from home, is it *really* snowing?

It's the first of a new month in a what is already a long fuckin year. But hey I finally have a site design I don't actively hate at the moment so that's always a plus. I can't even recall what revision this is, probably 4? 5? Maybe 6. Maybe I'll be happy with this one long term. I was able to get a better handle on the site generator this time around, my last attempt was sorely lacking and was a weird Frankenstein's monster of broken shit; this one at least marginally works without (what feels like) me doing incorrect things in order for it to just generate the html. This version is *just* basic enough while being fully complete (to the best of my knowledge) that it can finally act as a kind of functional smorgasbord of ideas and things. Will I ever actually **do** any of those "ideas" or "things"? Most likely, no. But it's fun to dream right?

I spent most of my day kind of stewing over what a disaster the past year has been overall, and how it's really starting to feel like this whole year is going to be a wash due to covid and the absolute fuck up in vaccine rollout. Potentially 2 years of life taken from everyone because a death cult ruled the country at the onset. Fuck Republicans. I can't believe 400,000+ people died, millions of people facing eviction, and a complete collapse of the economy for no reason other than pure hatred of the people you represented. Of course some people ended up richer than when it all started so I guess mission accomplished on that front because in the end that's really what mattered...

It did snow a bit today which is nice. I like snow. It's calming and peaceful. I just wish I had a fireplace. Now _that_ would be nice. 

Also, it's movie night. And the movie tonight is Rogue One, secretly a top tier Star Wars movie.
