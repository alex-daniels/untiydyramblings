        <p>It&rsquo;s the first of a new month in a what is already a long fuckin year. But hey I finally have a site design I don&rsquo;t actively hate at the moment so that&rsquo;s always a plus. I can&rsquo;t even recall what revision this is, probably 4? 5? Maybe 6. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be happy with this one long term. I was able to get a better handle on the site generator this time around, my last attempt was sorely lacking and was a weird Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster of broken shit; this one at least marginally works without (what feels like) me doing incorrect things in order for it to just generate the html. This version is <em>just</em> basic enough while being fully complete (to the best of my knowledge) that it can finally act as a kind of functional smorgasbord of ideas and things. Will I ever actually <strong>do</strong> any of those &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; or &ldquo;things&rdquo;? Most likely, no. But it&rsquo;s fun to dream right?</p>
<p>I spent most of my day kind of stewing over what a disaster the past year has been overall, and how it&rsquo;s really starting to feel like this whole year is going to be a wash due to covid and the absolute fuck up in vaccine rollout. Potentially 2 years of life taken from everyone because a death cult ruled the country at the onset. Fuck Republicans. I can&rsquo;t believe 400,000+ people died, millions of people facing eviction, and a complete collapse of the economy for no reason other than pure hatred of the people you represented. Of course some people ended up richer than when it all started so I guess mission accomplished on that front because in the end that&rsquo;s really what mattered&hellip;</p>
<p>It did snow a bit today which is nice. I like snow. It&rsquo;s calming and peaceful. I just wish I had a fireplace. Now <em>that</em> would be nice.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s movie night. And the movie tonight is Rogue One, secretly a top tier Star Wars movie.
